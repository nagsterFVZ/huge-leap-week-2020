# huge-leap-week-2020
### Description
Website I built for a school event called The Huge Leap Week. I was responsible for all the front end while Juul did the REST service and rest API. I also worked on parts of the API, mostly on registering tickets.

### Note 
The website does not need a DB to run or function, the db is just for the ticket system, but that also requires the API

### How to run
1. Open a terminal in the directory and run `npm i`
2. Open a terminal in the directory and run `npm audit fix`
3. Now run `npm run watch`
